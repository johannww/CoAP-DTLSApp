# CoAP-DTLSApp
An application regarding the use of sensors, Raspberry Pi 3, CoAP and DTLS. It uses sensors to read temperature and get the GPS location
and send this information to a server. The communication between the Raspberry Pi and the server is done through a DTLS socket used by 
the CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) instance.
